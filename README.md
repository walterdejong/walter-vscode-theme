Walter Visual Studio Code Theme
===============================

These are my personal customized themes for Visual Studio Code:

* Walter in the Dark
* Walter in the Light

used mostly for programming in C/C++, Python, bash, and writing in markdown,
but I'm sure they're usable for other languages as well.

In my opinion most editor themes use too many different colors, resulting
in 'color soup' and an uneasy view to look at. My dark and light theme
use a few basic colors to paint a calm, but clear picture.

The dark theme uses:
* light gray text on black background
* white accents for language types and numbers
* yellow accents for language macros (not in Python)
* green comments
* cyan strings
* green cursor

The light theme uses:
* black text on a light paper background
* redbrown language types
* dark green comments and numbers (for variation)
* cobalt blue strings
* green cursor


These themes were adapted from the dark/light C++ theme for VS Code
provided by Microsoft. They are FREE for you to use and/or modify,
